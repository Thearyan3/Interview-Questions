//Question No. 1 - What are objects in javascript?

// -->In JavaScript, objects are variables that store collections of key-value pairs, which can include properties and methods. They are a core data structure that allows developers to group related data together and split code into logical pieces. 
// Some characteristics of JavaScript objects are as follows :
// (i). Properties :- Named values that describe an object's characteristics. For example, a cup's properties might include its color, design, weight, and material. 
// (ii). Methods :- Functions or actions that an object can perform. For example, a fan's methods might include cooling rooms and controlling humidity. 
// (iii). Data types :- Objects can contain all other JavaScript data types, such as strings, numbers, and Booleans.
